                                    <p>Create a new folder in websys for Lab 7 named lab7, and confirm that it is being served by Apache. For this lab, you will be using <a href="lab7start.php">existing PHP code</a>. Save the document as lab7.php in your lab7 folder.</p>
                                    <h2>Part 1: Object Oriented PHP</h2>
                                    <p>For this lab, you will be developing a (very) basic calculator using PHP. The markup has been provided for you, along with some sample code to get you started.</p>
                                    <p>The sample code provided to you defines an <em>abstract class</em> called Operation. Abstract classes are not instantiated themselves, but are used to provide a basis for other subclassed implementations while still defining some of their default methods. An example implementation can be found in the Addition subclass, which implements the abstract methods defined in Operation::operate() and Operation::getEquation() to perform basic addition on the two operands passed into the constructor.</p>
                                    <p>To complete Part 1, implement subclasses for Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Cube, and Factorial in the same way.</p>
                                    <h2>Part 2: POST Handling</h2>
                                    <p>As you will see, the same form may have multiple submit buttons: only the button pressed will submit its value via the request body in the resulting POST request. Therefore, we can test to see which has been sent, and perform different operations based on the result. To see what has been passed in via $_POST for debugging purposes, we can use var_dump($_POST);.</p>
                                    <p>Hint: You will want to check isset($var_name) to determine if a value exists before reading it. PHP will raise a warning if you attempt to read from a variable that has not yet been defined.</p>
                                    <p>To receive credit for Part 2, for each button, instantiate a new object corresponding to the given operation and the two operands provided.  (ie "Multiply" should create a Multiply() instance from the two text fields when POSTed back to itself, and so on). Then, use your new object's getEquation() method to print the full equation inside pre#result.</p>
                                    <p>Another Hint: Review the Addition subclass carefully - Using the principles of Object Oriented Programming, particularly Polymorphism, to your advantage makes life easier.</p>
                                    <p>You don't have to write the code for handling each individual operation in the suggested place in the example: you may move it if it makes more sense to you.</p>
                                    <h2>Receiving Credit</h2>
                                    <p>Firstly - <strong>REMEMBER</strong> your README.md files.</p>
                                    <p>Style the calculator in some creative way (jQueryUI perhaps?)</p>
                                    <p>Answer the following questions in the README.
                                    <p>Explain what each of your classes and methods does, the order in which methods are invoked, and the flow of execution after one of the operation buttons has been clicked.</p>
                                    <p>Also explain how the application would differ if you were to use $_GET, and why this may or may not be preferable.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, please explain whether or not there might be another (better +/-) way to determine which button has been pressed and take the appropriate action</p>
