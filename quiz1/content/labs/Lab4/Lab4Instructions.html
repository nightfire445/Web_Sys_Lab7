                                    <p>Create a new folder for lab4, and confirm that it is being served by Apache.</p>
                                    <p>Ensure that you have a browser plugin capable of debugging JavaScript (you should be familiar with setting breakpoints and watch variables from your previous CS/IT courses). If you are stuck with this check out the documentation for Chrome Developer tools</p>
                                    <p>For this lab, you will be using <a href="lab4start.html">an existing HTML document</a>. Save the document as lab4.html in your lab4 folder.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must execute this lab from your webservers.  Attempting to run the JavaScript from your local file system will not work reliably (if at all)</p>
                                    <h2>Part 1 (JSON):</h2>
                                    <p>In most cases JSON is dynamically generated the same way as XML (or any other interchange format), though we will be generating it ourselves for this lab. Create a JSON document describing your songs from Lab 2, and save it as lab4.json. Your JSON should contain the same information about your song as we displayed in that lab: i.e.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Track name</li>
                                        <li>Artist</li>
                                        <li>Album</li>
                                        <li>Album Cover Art URL</li>
                                        <li>Date</li>
                                        <li>Artist Site URL</li>
                                        <li>Genres</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Pay attention to the data structures being used, just as you would pay attention to the semantic correctness and proper nesting of an XML document (for instance, consider making your value for Genres an array (but not required)). <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSON Lint</a> is a great tool for ensuring that your JSON is valid.</p>
                                    <p><strong>To receive credit for Part 1:</strong> Show the JSON representation of your favorite song. (You will be graded on the following: Validity:10, Readability:10, Completeness:10, Symantic Meaning:10)</p>
                                    <h2>Part 2 (AJAX and jQuery):</h2>
                                    <p>Copy the <a href="lab4start.html">Lab 4 example</a> to lab4.html if you haven't already.</p>
                                    <p>After clicking on the "No Album" image, your page must make an AJAX GET request for your JSON using jQuery, and populate the HTML according to each property. For example, the title must appear in #title, the artist's name must appear in #artist, etc. Have a look at jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/attr/">.attr() documentation</a> to see how you might do this for img#coverart and a#site. There are no restrictions on the jQuery methods you may use, though you will obviously have to modify the HTML to include jQuery first.</p>
                                    <p><strong>To receive credit for Part 2:</strong> Show that clicking on your image loads the values from your JSON into the appropriate places of your document. (You will be graded on the following: Validity:10, Readability:10, Completeness:20,  Accuracy to Lab 2 output:20, Creativity:20)</p>
